# Where opencode stores session history

The opencode layout supported here stores sessions in a SQLite database at `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/opencode.db` when configured:

```
~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db
```

It follows the XDG base directory spec, so `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/opencode.db` wins if that variable is set. That applies on macOS too, where most apps would use `~/Library/Application Support`.

In this supported layout, sessions are database rows rather than individual JSONL files. Query SQLite to inspect them instead of assuming a recursive text search can extract a conversation. Older file-based layouts are outside this adapter's scope.

## The four tables that matter

```sql
project  -- id (sha1), worktree (the project directory), vcs, time_*
session  -- id ("ses_…"), project_id, parent_id, slug, title, directory,
         -- model (JSON), tokens_* (5 columns), cost, time_created,
         -- time_updated, time_archived
message  -- id ("msg_…"), session_id, time_created, data (JSON envelope)
part     -- id ("prt_…"), message_id, session_id, time_created, data (JSON body)
```

The database has more tables (`workspace`, `todo`, `permission`, `event`, `credential` and migration bookkeeping), but a transcript is `session` → `message` → `part`.

`message.data` is a JSON envelope: `role`, `modelID`, `providerID`, `tokens{input,output,reasoning,cache{read,write}}`, `cost`, `time{created,completed}`. `part.data` is the body, with a `type` of `text`, `reasoning`, `tool`, `file`, `step-start`, `step-finish` and others.

## Sub-agent sessions

A session with a non-null `parent_id` is a sub-agent run spawned by another session. The viewer hides these from the ordinary history list but includes their recorded work in statistics. They can contain usage and costs; a local model, provider pricing or missing fields can yield zero recorded cost. A sub-agent run is not proof of a separately billed API call.

## Open it read-only

opencode's TUI may be writing while you inspect the database. Use a read-only connection to avoid accidental writes; busy or changing databases can still require retrying after activity settles. The command also respects a configured XDG data root:

```bash
sqlite3 "file:${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/opencode/opencode.db?mode=ro" ".tables"
```

## Reading an opencode transcript with SQL

List sessions with their project and cost, newest first:

```sql
SELECT s.id, p.worktree, s.title, s.cost,
       datetime(s.time_created/1000, 'unixepoch') AS created
FROM session s
JOIN project p ON p.id = s.project_id
WHERE s.parent_id IS NULL
ORDER BY s.time_created DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

Print one session's text, in order:

```sql
SELECT json_extract(m.data, '$.role') AS role,
       json_extract(pt.data, '$.text') AS text
FROM message m
JOIN part pt ON pt.message_id = m.id
WHERE m.session_id = 'ses_...'
  AND json_extract(pt.data, '$.type') = 'text'
ORDER BY m.time_created, pt.time_created;
```

Sum session-recorded costs per project:

```sql
SELECT p.worktree, ROUND(SUM(s.cost), 2) AS usd, COUNT(*) AS sessions
FROM session s JOIN project p ON p.id = s.project_id
GROUP BY p.worktree ORDER BY usd DESC;
```

The last query includes sub-agent rows on purpose. It sums `session.cost`, which is a stored value, not a provider invoice. Desktop statistics instead read assistant-message costs; the two aggregations need not agree if records are missing or inconsistent.

## Why cost has to come from the database {#cost-from-db}

opencode can use different providers or local models, so a price table keyed only by model name may not reflect that setup. The viewer reads `modelID`, `tokens` and `cost` from assistant-message records rather than repricing them with its catalog. Missing numeric message costs currently default to zero; this means unmeasured cost, not verified free work. Recorded cost is not an independently verified invoice. Compare financial decisions with the provider's actual usage report; see [usage and cost boundaries](/features/stats#cost-vs-bill).

## How do I resume this session?

Run `opencode --session SESSION_ID` from the project's directory with opencode installed. The app offers [terminal resume](/features/resume), not in-app opencode chat.

## View and search opencode history {#view-and-search}

[Install Sessions Viewer](/guide/install), select opencode, then choose a project to read its supported SQLite sessions. Use `⌘⇧F` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) for session titles and saved user prompts across opencode projects, or switch to ID mode. This does not search assistant answers or tool output; see [search scope](/features/read-and-search#search-scope).

Export Markdown, HTML or parsed-message JSON after reviewing private content; keep the native database for archival needs. [Export limits](/features/export-and-trash) include external/unreadable images. Continuing uses the installed opencode CLI in a terminal, not an opencode in-app chat. Sessions Viewer is an independent open-source project, not an official opencode product. Check [privacy](/guide/privacy) before resuming or sharing.

## Source and limitations

Path, recorded-cost and viewer-operation wording reviewed on 2026-10-06 against the [0.6.0 opencode adapter](https://github.com/jerrywu001/cc-sessions-viewer/blob/69e0b4f/src-tauri/src/agents/opencode.rs) and [search implementation](https://github.com/jerrywu001/cc-sessions-viewer/blob/69e0b4f/src-tauri/src/agents/mod.rs). This is source review and synthetic-test scope, not CLI runtime certification. Upstream: [opencode documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/).

SQL examples target the database schema described above; they do not cover older file-based layouts. Read-only queries are distinct from explicit rename/trash/restore actions that write to the database. See [missing-session troubleshooting](/guide/troubleshooting).

## Or open it in an app

[Sessions Viewer](/guide/) queries this database read-only, hides sub-agent sessions from the list while still counting them in the stats, and shows opencode conversations next to your JSONL-based agents in the same view. It also reads [Claude Code](/agents/claude-code), [Codex](/agents/codex), [Grok Build](/agents/grok-build), [Kimi Code](/agents/kimi-code), [Pi](/agents/pi) and [Antigravity CLI](/agents/antigravity-cli).
